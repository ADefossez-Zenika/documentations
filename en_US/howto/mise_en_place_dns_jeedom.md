# Implementation of Jeedom DNS

## Objectif

Set up Jeedom DNS to have access to your Jeedom externally via a HTTPS URL

> **IMPORTANT**
>
>The Jeedom DNS acts as a reverse proxy so it only gives access to your Jeedom in https, it will therefore not be possible to access your jeedom in SSH remotely with the Jeedom DNS

## Prerequisites

To have access to Jeedom DNS it is absolutely necessary to have a service pack power or more.

## Principe

The principle of Jeedom DNS is very simple, your Jeedom will connect to one of our VPN servers (encrypted connection). Then this server in question with us makes "reverse proxy" during the request : it takes your request to connect to your jeedom and transfers it to it.

This principle has the advantage of not exposing your Jeedom on the internet, no port opening to do.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> For this to work, your box must allow an outgoing connection on ports 1194,1195,1996,1997,1198,1199,2000 and 2001 in UDP. In particular for the Huawei Livebox and 4g router, you have to lower the firewall level, for people at free it is also sometimes necessary to switch to a fixed ip (otherwise free sharing your ip between several users which poses concerns for the DNS) more for Freebox Delta you have to deactivate parental control

We currently have 6 DNS servers distributed on 2 different physical machines, each having a 500Mbit / s connection. 

## Set up

### Jeedom

There it is super simple, you must connect your Jeedom to the market (see documentation first-step). 

### Market

Une fois votre Jeedom liÃ© au market, vous allez sur le market; puis sur votre profils (https://www.jeedom.com/market/index.php?v = d & p = profiles) and finally on the tab "My Jeedoms".

### Return to Jeedom

Once the market status at "Connection possible", go to your Jeedom, in the administration of it go to the Networks tab and check "Use Jeedom DNS" then save.

Jeedom will start the DNS and give you your access url to your Jeedom

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> You can change this url by going to your market profiles page then go to my Jeedoms. Please note any change takes 24 hours before being effective

Here is your Jeedom is accessible from the outside in https

## FAQ

> **Is there a need to open ports on my box**
>
> No there is no need to open a port from your internet box to your Jeedom. The connection is in the Jeedom -> VPN direction, so it is an outgoing connection (on ports 1194,1195,1996 and 1997) and not an incoming connection.

> **Why Jeedom DNS protects my access to it**
>
> Jeedom DNS allows you to set up something very important, HTTPS access, this guarantees that the connection between your browser and your Jeedom is encrypted, moreover the certificate being valid nobody will be able to impersonate your Jeedom. Finally the VPN connection in your Jeedom and our servers is also encrypted.

> **I changed the internal listening port of my Jeedom and the Jeedom DNS no longer work**
>
> Indeed the Jeedom DNS only works if your Jeedom is listening on local port 80 (all the other ports are closed on the VPN interface when connecting). This does not pose security concerns because the VPN creates an encrypted tunnel, so even if the flow is in clear on port 80 it is encrypted in the VPN tunnel.

> **I don't have the login page but can't login**
>
> Check that you have changed the default jeedom credentials (admin / admin) and that your user is not restricted locally only.

> **My configuration is good but impossible to have a page it turns endlessly**
>
> If your configuration is correct (Initialization Sequence Completed in the log openvpn_DNS_Jeedom) but you cannot get the login page which works with the mobile application randomly and you are in 4g or at the end of the ADSL line. In this case, you must check the box in the jeedom network configuration like what you are in 4g and relaunch the dns like that jeedom will change the mtu of your connection to reduce the size of the packets.
