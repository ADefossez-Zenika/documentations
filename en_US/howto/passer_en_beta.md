# Go to beta

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Activating beta plugins is very very risky and you **FORBIDDEN ALL ACCESS TO THE SUPPORT**.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Beta versions are often unstable and can cause a lot of problems, so don't put them on a production system. IN CASE OF CONCERN, THE JEEDOM TEAM WILL NOT BE AND CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE.

> **NOTE**
>
> This documentation is voluntarily little detailed so that the operation is not easy. Indeed, being in beta requires skills both in IT and in deciphering logs or documentation.

## Switch the core to beta

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> A beta update can completely break your Jeedom and make it unrecoverable. In case of worries you will have NO SUPPORT, you will have to fend for yourself.

## Beta plugins

To do this, go to the Jeedom Market, then in your profile, section **My profile**, check the box to have access to beta plugins.

Then, in your Jeedom, on the plugin files, you should see a button "install beta".

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Any plugin installed in beta prohibits full access to the support, even if your problem does not concern this plugin.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Any support request for beta testing, or a concern with a beta component, or a system that has already had a beta core or plugin, will be closed immediately without any response from us.
