# Dyson plugin

Plugin to control Dyson equipment, for the moment only the Hot + Cool Cryptomic purifier has been tested (but the other purifier should be quick to add)

# Configuration

After installing the dependencies, all you need to do is enter your Dyson identifiers, (re) launch the demon and do a synchronization from the plugin page. Your equipment should appear.

>**NOTE**
>
>Once the demon launched the plugin works locally (it connects directly to the equipment ip)

# FAQ

>**My equipment is created but the model and the orders are not good**
>
>You must send a request for support (and support) to Jeedom SAS with the model of the equipment as well as the type (it is in advanced configuration -> information -> configuration -> device). It is also possible that the support asks you for the debug logs of the plugin (in particular after the execution of the refresh command)
