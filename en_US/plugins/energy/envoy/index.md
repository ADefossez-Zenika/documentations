# Enphase Envoy plugin

Plugin to collect photovoltaic information from Envoy gateways

# Configuration

In order to configure the plugin, it is necessary to fill in the following information :

- Gateway IP address sent
- Sender password (if it has not been changed, these are the last 6 characters of the serial number.)

Then, by clicking on the "Synchronize" button, all equipment will be automatically created.
