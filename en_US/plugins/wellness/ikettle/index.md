# Ikettle plugin

This plugin allows you to manage your Smarter Ikettle kettles (attention only V1 and V2).

# Plugin configuration 

After installing the plugin, you just need to activate it. If the outbuildings are OK, enter the IP for your kettle and save. Logically the equipment will create itself.

# Equipment configuration 

The configuration of Ikettle equipment is accessible from the plugins menu then Comfort. You will find here :

-   a button to display the configuration of the plugin
-   a button that gives you an overview of all your equipment

By clicking on one of your equipment you arrive on the configuration page of your equipment including 2 tabs, equipment and controls.

We find the measured temperature, the water level (arbitrary does not work well), the presence or not of the kettle on its base, the different actions as well as the status.
