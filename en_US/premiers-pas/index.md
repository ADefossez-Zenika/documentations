Find your Jeedom on the network 
==================================

Once Jeedom is electrically connected and connected to your local network,
here's how to connect to it.

Find Jeedom 
--------------

### Through the market 

Simplest solution (but does not work in 100% of cases in
depending on the configuration of your internet access), you must start
the box, wait about 10 minutes (be careful if you use a
netinstallation type image, it will be rather 30min) and go
[ici](https://www.jeedom.com/market/index.php?v=d&p=find)

> **Tip**
>
> Attention, you must be on the same network as the Jeedom box for
> this method works.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Depending on your ADSL box this functionality may not work.
> If so, nothing serious, just log in to
> your ADSL box and find the jeedom IP in it. This step
> does nothing but give you the local IP of your Jeedom.
> It is not then that adding your Jeedom to your account
> market is done.

### By your internet box 

-   Go to the administration interface of your internet box and
    search Jeedom in your network devices.

-   Get his IP.

-   Put this IP in your internet browser. You should be
    on the Jeedom interface.

First connection 
------------------

Whichever method is used, you will then arrive on the page of
login. By default the login and password are "admin".

    Administration → Configuration

-   Click on the tab **Updates**

-   Check the box **Activate**

-   Fill in the address : `https://www.jeedom.com/market`

    Jeedom)

    is done correctly.

For more details on the configuration page click
[ici](https://github.com/jeedom/core/blob/stable/doc/en_US/administration.asciidoc)
.

Get my direct access URL 
==============================

If you have a Service Pack, Jeedom will provide you with a URL
direct access to your Jeedom without having to open the ports on
your box or other.

To configure it, just go to
General → Administration → Configuration

Then go to the "Network configuration" section"

![premier dns2](images/premier-dns2.png)

Once here, you just need to activate "Use Jeedom DNS" then
on the "Management" line to do "Restart" and your URL will appear at
HTTP status level, you can of course customize it from
the Market profile page

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> If you have just linked your Jeedom to your Market account, you must
> wait 24 to 48 hours before you can use the DNS service

Change Jeedom's default password

your Jeedom account, for that click on Administration → Users
(top right):

Once on it you just have to choose the line with the user
**admin** and click on **To change the password** :
