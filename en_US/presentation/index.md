Around this core are plugins which can be
all kinds :

-   home automation protocol (Z-Wave, RFXcom, EnOcean…),

-   IP protocol (KNX, xPL…),

-   communicating object (Nest, Netatmo…),

-   high level (alarm, thermostat ...),

-   interface (widget),

-   organization (calendar, Google calendar),

-   development (script).

These plugins can be retrieved via Market and allow you to extend
Jeedom's possibilities.

Jeedom allows any plugin to chat with another on a
standardized base. This allows for example to use plugins
thermostat or alarm with any home automation protocol or even a
IP plugin or communicating object…

Principle
=== 

Jeedom has the distinction of being without subscription and without cloud, which
ensures the functioning of your home automation even if you
no longer have internet. This also guarantees the security of your data
(avoids the risks of mass hacking of accounts).

The project being open and open source this also guarantees it a strong
evolution rate thanks to the many developers who participate.

Links
===

Several video tutorials were made to show the
important features of Jeedom, facilitate its use and
familiarize the user with the software.

However since the realization of these tutorials, the Jeedom interface
was able to evolve and functionalities added. The documentation therefore remains
the reference to consult in case of needs, questions, etc..
