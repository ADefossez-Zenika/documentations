Jeedom is an open-source and * cloudless * home automation solution (without server in the cloud). It works without subscription, which guarantees the functioning of your home automation without internet, as well as the security of your data.. It is also extremely open, multi-protocol, customizable, and highly scalable.

Jeedom offers a core, the Core, embedding the structure and the central functions.

Différents (plugins)[https://market.jeedom.com] can then propose new functions.

The Core includes:

- Access to the Dashboard or the Synthesis.

*Equipment, including actuators or sensors, is organized by objects. Objects can, for example, represent physical parts*.

The scenarios are built with different blocks. Conditional blocks (If Then, Otherwise), actions, programming (IN x minutes or A hhmm), loop, comment, or php code. All blocks are nestable into each other, offering endless possibilities.
