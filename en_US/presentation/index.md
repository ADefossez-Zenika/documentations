Around this core are plugins that can be of all kinds :

-   home automation protocol (Z-Wave, RFXcom, EnOcean…),
-   IP protocol (KNX, xPL…),
-   communicating object (Nest, Netatmo…),
-   high level (alarm, thermostat ...),
-   interface (widget),
-   organization (calendar, Google calendar),
-   development (script).

These plugins can be retrieved via Market and allow you to extend the possibilities of Jeedom.

Jeedom allows any plugin to chat with another on a standardized basis. This allows for example to use the thermostat or alarm plugins with any home automation protocol or even an IP plugin or communicating object ...

Principle
=== 

Jeedom has the particularity of being without subscription and without cloud, which makes it possible to guarantee the functioning of your home automation even if you no longer have internet. This also guarantees the security of your data (avoids the risks of mass hacking of accounts).

The project being open and open source this also guarantees it a high rate of development thanks to the many developers who participate.

However since the realization of these tutorials, the Jeedom interface has been able to evolve and functionalities added. The documentation therefore remains the reference to consult in case of needs, questions, etc..
