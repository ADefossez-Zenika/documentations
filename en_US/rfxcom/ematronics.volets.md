Search for remote control ID 
-------------------------------------

Note: Ematronic remote controls always start with : 
so the area that interests us starts from "Test message" : .

Spot : Id1 and Id2 and add the following hexadecimal : in my example
Id1 =  and Id2 = 84. so you should locate them in the line, "Test
message "and extract Id3, here Id3 = B9, Our remote control has
as ID â‡’ 84B9.

Stop Debug Mode by the button "Stop / Restart the daemon"
