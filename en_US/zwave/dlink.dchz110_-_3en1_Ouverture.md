    (in seconds)

\

Faq. 
------

\

This module wakes up by pressing its association button.

\

This module is a battery module, the new configuration will be
taken into account at the next wakeup. (association button for
force, hence the interest of not installing the module before its
good configuration)

\

---------------

\

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> You have to wake up the module : after its inclusion, after a change
> of the configuration, after a change of wakeup, after a
