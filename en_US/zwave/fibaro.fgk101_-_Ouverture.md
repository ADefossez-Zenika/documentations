\

Summary 
------

\

This battery-powered and Z-Wave compatible detector has a sensor
reed, a proximity switch with magnetic operation, which
detects the opening of a door or window when the
two elements are distant.

The device consists of a part with a magnet (the part
mobile), attached to the door or window, as well as the unit
main positioned on the fixed part of the window / door with
screw or adhesive. When the two parts are no longer opposite, a
Z-Wave radio signal is automatically sent.

In addition, this detector has an analog input allowing
connect a 1-Wire DS18B20 temperature probe. This detector has
also from a wired input, so it can be used as a
universal transmitter : leave aside its magnetic contact, and
connect its screw inputs to any detector (normally closed) of your
choice such as smoke, gas or carbon monoxide detector,
etc.

A Z-Wave controller (remote control, dongle, Etc.?.) is required in order to
integrate this detector into your network if you already have a network
existant.

\

Parameter details :

\

-   Wakeup? : this is the Module?'s wake-up interval (value
    7200 recommended)

-   1: sets the delay for canceling the IN input alarm
    (dry contact)

-   2: allows to choose if the blue led should flash on opening and
    closing your door for example

-   3: used to define the contact type connected to the terminal block (IN)

-   5: not recommended to change this setting unless you know why
    (defines the type of signal sent to association group 1)

-   7: value sent to association group 1

-   9: allows you to set the sending of the cancellation signal between the IN input
    and association group 1

-   12: allows to adjust the sensitivity to temperature change (if
    a 1 wire probe is connected to the Module?)

-   13: allows to set the sending in broadcast mode of the signals of
    temperature and tamper

-   14: activates the scene activation feature

\

### Groups? 

\

This Module has three association groups, only the third is

------

\

This Module wakes up by pressing 3 times on one of the tamper buttons. But
the other tamper button must be pressed.

\

This Module has a very low range. It is advisable to do
inclusion closest to your box.

\

This Module is a battery Module?, the new configuration will be
taken into account at the next wakeup.

\

IMPORTANT note 
---------------

\

> **Important**
>
> You have to wake up the Module : after its inclusion, after a change
> of the configuration, after a change of wakeup, after a
> change of association groups
